### CSS Foundations - The Box Model

- Every element on a web page is held in a box.
- Width and height refers to content.
- Padding adds around the content.
- Border adds around the content; separates the content from the margin.
- Margin adds around the border; separates one box's border from another's. Note that margins overlap.
- Use the Inspect tool for a diagram of the box.
- To space 2 elements away from each other: Use margin.
- To space out element from itself: Use padding.
- `boxing-sizing: border-box;`: Height and width will include border and padding. The content box will be smaller.
